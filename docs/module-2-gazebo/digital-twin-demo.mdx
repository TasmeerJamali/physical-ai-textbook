# Interactive Digital Twin

Welcome to the **Physical AI Lab**! 🧪

Before we deploy code to a real robot, we must simulate it. This is called a **Digital Twin**.
Below is a live, interactive 3D simulation of a 4-DOF (Degree of Freedom) robotic arm, running directly in your browser using **Forward Kinematics**.

## 🕹️ Try It Yourself

Use the sliders below to control the robot's joints. Notice how the movement of one joint affects the position of all subsequent links.

## 🧠 How It Works

This simulation demonstrates **Forward Kinematics**: calculating the position of the "End Effector" (the gripper) based on the angles of the joints.

In **Module 1**, we learned the math behind this. In **Module 2**, we use Gazebo to simulate physics (gravity, collisions). Here, we use a lightweight web renderer to visualize the geometry.

### The Kinematic Chain

1.  **Base (J1)**: Rotates the entire arm around the vertical axis (Yaw).
2.  **Shoulder (J2)**: Lifts the main arm up and down (Pitch).
3.  **Elbow (J3)**: Extends or retracts the forearm (Pitch).
4.  **Wrist (J4)**: Rotates the gripper (Roll).

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that you've played with the Digital Twin, let's learn how to control it with code using **ROS 2** in the next chapter!
